- Data on protest obtained from Ron Francisco's webpage. All databases can be downloaded from [here](https://ronfran.ku.edu/data/index.html). 

- Cliftonville FC data provided by Haydn Milligan. 

-  Matches of Derry City FC obtained from [Extratime.com](https://www.extratime.com/teams/results/7/derry-city/?results=1987)

### 1.2. Data for the control variables.

- Socio-economic data obtained from [UKCensus](https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/)

## 2. Harvesting & Cleaning 

This step allow to harvest the data from the original sources and prepare it for the future aggregation. This step mostly focus renaming and providing the time and location of the events in an standardised way.
